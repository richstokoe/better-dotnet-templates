# Better .NET Templates
Better Templates provides templates for .NET developers that are designed around good practices and patterns.

The default .NET templates often change in order to advertise new features of .NET rather than encouraging good development practices. Better Templates is designed to provide a set of stable templates that are ready for building long-lasting, well-architected applications that scale.

## MVC Feature Slices (mvcfeatures)
Where the default MVC project template reinforces several anti-patterns (poor separation of concerns, project structure designs around the technology choice rather than the business problem), the Better Templates MVC Features template allows developers to neatly separate each feature of their MVC app into its own separate folder.
